It is the fork of [October Rain's](https://github.com/octoberrain) [Test plugin](https://github.com/octoberrain/test-plugin) and is a great way to show functionality of Power Components.

This plugin differs only in components using Power Components. What is more, they are used by [Power Components demo theme](https://github.com/initbizlab/pc-demo-theme) and are great combination to test and see how lists and forms can be created using Power Components.
